### usage

did does fire and forget timetracking. you open the app via a global hotkey and type a concise description of the task/event you just completed in the already focused text field. you can add a duration to the event by entering ```+```-signs. they are interpreted as 10 min units and added up to estimate the length of the event.

### example

entering a message like "meeting with paul ++" would result in a record that reads "meeting with paul" from 20 minutes ago to now.

### goals

provide a small standalone app, that allows users to retrospectively track events. aiming for a fire-and-forget workflow, where the window appears triggered by a global shortcut and hidden immediatly after data input.
